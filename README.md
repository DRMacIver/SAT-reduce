# SAT-reduce

SAT-reduce is a domain-specific test-case reducer for SAT problems. That is, given a file in CNF format, and some script that defines a condition that file should satisfy, it will produce a smaller version of that file.

It's mostly alpha-quality software written for my own purposes, but also it's probably by far the most effective tool you'll find for that problem because I'm one of only a handful of people who writes this sort of thing, so if that's a thing you want then this is probably your best bet.

Support level is "best effort and subject to current levels of interest" - please do file any issues you find. I will probably fix them, but I make no guarantees.
